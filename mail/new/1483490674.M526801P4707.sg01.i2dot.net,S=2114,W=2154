Dear Site Owner,

Every day, criminals compromise thousands of websites. Hacks are often invisible to users, yet remain harmful to anyone viewing the page including the site owner. For example, unbeknownst to the site owner, the hacker may have infected their site with harmful code which in turn can record keystrokes on visitors computers, stealing login credentials for online banking or financial transactions.

So we have decided to fight back against the hackers. When we clean a website we set our servers off to actively look for other websites that have been infected with this same hack. When they find one we actively try to contact the owners and let them know they have been compromised.

You can scan your website for FREE (yes, free!) with multiple scanners at https://www.unifysec.com

We do this in order to improve security on the Internet and to help people get their website secure. If a consulting service is needed, we are free to help. That is how we make our money.

Best Regards,
Unifysec Team
